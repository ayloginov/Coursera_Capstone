## Backgroud and Business Problem

In this project we will be looking at the dental care services supply in Prague.
Czech Republic is one of the Eastern European countries that went through a successful transformation from ex-communist to market economy. The country has a diversified economy that grows by 3-5% per annum compared to 1.5-2.5% on average for EU. The per capita GDP (nominal) is 22.6 kUSD, services sector accounts for about 60% of the economy.

Prague is a relatively large city with the population of 1.3 million people (13th largest city in the EU). It is located in the center of Europe, in a several hours' driving distance from such 'richer' countries as Germany and Austria. Prague is a quite popular tourist destination, annually it welcomes more than 8 million visitors.

Our analysis below covers the dental services supply in Prague. Our report is targeted at the stakeholders interested in opening a dental clinic in this city. 

We will explore how developed is the dental services market in Prague. More specifically, how many dental clinics are there, where are they located? Are they spread evenly across the city or tend to concentrate in particular areas? Is the distribution pattern similar to other cities? Is the competition high or low compared to other cities?
